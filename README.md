ImmuneLite gives you the ability to scan your smart contract code to find the underlying vulnerabilities listed in the sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qiN27zqaVhNk-uTlLTbEhOBoMNPPXfmd90QpmVMe4SQ/edit#gid=143538190) ðŸ”—.

## Contributing

---

At the core of our philosophy lies the belief that everyone has the ability to contribute and enact meaningful change. Whether you're passionate about coding, adept at bug-fixing, or simply eager to share feedback, your contributions are invaluable and warmly welcomed.

We invite active security researchers and auditors in the Web3 security domain to contribute to ImmuneLite. Your expertise can help us enhance the tool's capabilities and ensure its effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts. 

Here's how you can contribute:

- **Add and Improve Detectors**: Enhance ImmuneLite by adding new detectors or improving existing ones to detect a wider range of vulnerabilities.
- **User Experience**: Help us refine the user experience to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure ImmuneLite is compatible with different operating systems to maximize its accessibility and usability.

We are also building an ML aspect to ImmuneLite, wherein we have employed new-gen deep learning algorithms to further eradicate the occurrence of false positives and increase the accuracy.
